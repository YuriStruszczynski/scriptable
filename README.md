# OneDayCalendarWidgetXS - Small iOS Widget

![OneDayCalendarWidgetXS](/images/OneDayCalendarWidgetXS.png)

Main code provided by yaylinda and her MultiDayCalendarWidget
https://github.com/yaylinda/scriptable

I changed yaylinda's code to display events from your calendars but only for today, with a customizable window of the number of hours to show. Number of hours, and the starting hour, are configurable within the script. The configuration also allows for filtering events from certain calendars. Please use the LARGE widget size for best display results.

Like in yaylinda's widget, all configurations/behaviors can be found by updating the WIDGET_CONFIGURATIONS (comments and descriptions included in the code).
